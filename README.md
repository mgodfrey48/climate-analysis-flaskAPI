# sqlalchemy-challenge
In this project I use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database. The analysis uses SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Using the initial analysis, I design a Flask API based on the queries that I just developed.
