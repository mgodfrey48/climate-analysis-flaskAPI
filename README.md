# sqlalchemy-challenge
In this project I use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database. The analysis uses SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Using the initial analysis, I design a Flask API based on the queries that I just developed.

To produce the initial analysis:
1. Clone this repository to your computer
2. Open `climate_starter.ipynb` in a jupyter notebook and run each cell.

To use the Flask API that produces various summaries and insights from the climate data:
1. Clone this repository to your computer
2. Open the repository in terminal
3. Run `app.py` and visit the server in Google Chrome
4. Visit the urls provided on the home page to pull the available data summaries.
